Munged from the Pebble v2 example code.

The example code was GPLv3, so all my stuff is too.

*bigclock*

A clock with a larger display, only settable via USB at this point. Can also drive the LEDs by serial command (eg. for load display)

*clock*

A clock settable with the rotary encoder. Can be programmed with the time from a USB-connected computer.

*falltoy*

Uses a 3-axis accelerometer and piezo; shows different colours on the RGB LED depending on which way is up, and screams if you drop it :)

*textout*

A twitter display for #lca2012, much like a tiny version of the big screens up around the place :-)

*pong*

What it says on the box.
